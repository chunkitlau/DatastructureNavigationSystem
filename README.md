# DatastructureNavigationSystem

## Overview

"Campus Navigation System" is a data structure course design for the second year of the School of Computer Science, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (Spring 2021). This project is a web-based campus navigation system application based on the separation of the front and back ends of the Javascript language. The front end is realized through the Vue.js framework, the back end is realized through the Node.js framework, the database is realized through Mysql, the drawing is realized through OpenLayers, and OpenStreetMap is used as the map. This project is realized for the purpose of curriculum design. Although it can run relatively well, there are some known and unknown errors, which may be updated according to the situation.

## 总览

《校园导览系统》是北京邮电大学计算机学院大学二年级数据结构课程设计（2021春）。本项目是基于Javascript语言的前后端分离的网页校园导览系统应用，通过Vue.js框架实现前端，通过Node.js框架实现后端，通过Mysql实现数据库，通过OpenLayers实现绘图，将OpenStreetMap作为地图。本项目为了课程设计而实现，虽然可以较为良好的运行，但是还有一些已知和未知的错误，可能会视情况更新。
